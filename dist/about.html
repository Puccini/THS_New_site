        <p>
          2019 marks my 40th year in Tech and IT. Over that period I've worked
          for some very large companies and also worked self employed in the UK and here in Spain, where I've lived for
          16 years.
        </p>
        <p>
          My experience over this period has been in both hardware
          <b class="text-tertiary">and</b> software which I believe gives me
          an excellent overall view of the Tech world.
        </p>
        <p>Over this time I've repaired and upgraded hundreds of Laptops, PCs & Phones. I've upgraded hardware and
          software and also advised many that their "device" is no longer sensible to "keep throwing money at" to keep
          it going. This, I believe, is the <b>proper way to do business.</b></p>

        <p>
          Do you need a a website OR does your website not perform as
          expected? I can help with either of these issues. Prices start at a
          very reasonable <b class="text-tertiary">â‚¬95</b> for a basic static
          site. View my Demos.

          There are many websites out there that are slow to load AND it is
          effecting the business. The owner is usually the last to realise. For
          a <b class="text-tertiary">FREE</b> assessment, and to understand the
          reason why this is true..

        <p>Maybe it's just confusing when you changed to a different phone. How about some instructions?</p>

        <h4 class="text-tertiary">Repair, Maintenance or Upgrade?</h4>
        <p>
          All types of Repairs to Laptops or PCs. Whatever your problem I can fix it. The question though, is should I
          fix it?
          <p>This is where my approach differs from many competitors. I will give you an honest assessment of
            whether or not I believe the repair makes sense in terms of cost. Of course, if you still want to have the
            device repaired then I will do it but you will do it having all the facts at your disposal.</p>

          <p> Any other pieces of tech you would like me to assess for repair, then that is fine too. Once again, if it
            is
            not viable to repair I will be totally honest.</p>
